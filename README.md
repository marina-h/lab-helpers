Lab Helpers
=============

My practice projects in Python!

**primer_helper:**

This is a simple python script that will:

1. calculate basic melting temperature of the primer (A/T=2°C and G/C=4°C)

2. print the reverse complement of the primer
	
**wobble maker:**

This is a python script that helps design primers for oligo recombineering.

1. Take a primer sequence with a point mutation

2. Modify the primer to include the specified number of wobble changes on both sides of the mutation.
